Bugs : 

    Display :
        main overlapping header and footer, when tables too high, messes up scroll (check student list on admin dashboard)
        "appel" card div doesn't shrink after submitting the mark-attendance form


Failed ideas :

    Tried to refactor the update classes, to have one single UpdateData class
    but this resulted in the user id number (however, i tried on students only, 
    so maybe it was updatin with their class's id, i haven't explored this option) 
    of the data to be in every input instead of the actually updated data

Functionalities :

    Add a display of the attendance :
        Admin dashboard : per class, per day, per schedule : list of absent student
        Teacher dashboard : same
        Student : list of day/schedule

    When creating a schedule, check there's no clashing schedule for the selected class and Teacher

    Error message when wrong email/password on login

    Success/Error messages when submitting a form

    Filter to display data in the wanted order (alphabetical for example)

    Add a weekly view of the schedules, using calendar js ?

                    schedule_id and signed_attendance which is left NULL) using a checkbox submitted form on the teacher dashboard and the retrieved ongoing schedule_id, 
                    student_id list from DisplayOngoingSchedule object with TeacherSchedule method)
                SendSignatureRequest (to display a "sign" button on the student dashboard, using the MarkAttendance method, with attributes schedule_id 
                    and student_id retrieved from DisplayOngoingSchedule object and TeacherSchedule method)
                SignAttendance (to feed the attendance table with a timestamp into the signed_attendance column, using MarkAttendance method, with attributes schedule_id

                    or if signed_attendance == NULL)
