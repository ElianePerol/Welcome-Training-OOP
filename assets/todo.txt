Bugs : 

    Display :
        main overlapping header and footer, when tables too high, messes up scroll (check student list on admin dashboard)
        "appel" card div doesn't shrink after submitting the mark-attendance form
    Functionalities :
        teachers see the daily schedule of all the teachers as their own
        student don't see their weekly schedule
        the list of absences on student and admin dashboard doesn't work
        on the deployed version the schedules on student and teacher dashboard don't display at all :
            "Warning: Undefined arry key 0 in /var/www/html/welcometraining.elianeperol.com/database/attendance/db-marked-attendance.php on line 17
             Warning: Trying to acccess array offset value of type null in /var/www/html/welcometraining.elianeperol.com/database/attendance/db-marked-attendance.php on line 17"
             the problem is not present on the locally run app


Failed ideas :

    Tried to refactor the update classes, to have one single UpdateData class
    but this resulted in the user id number (however, i tried on students only, 
    so maybe it was updatin with their class's id, i haven't explored this option) 
    of the data to be in every input instead of the actually updated data


Functionalities :

    Unit testing : required a tool, I know and have used PEST, for which I'd need to install composer, etc.

    When creating a schedule, check there's no clashing schedule for the selected class and Teacher
