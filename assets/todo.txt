Bugs : 

    Display :
        main overlapping header and footer, when tables too high, messes up scroll (check student list on admin dashboard)
        "appel" card div doesn't shrink after submitting the mark-attendance form


Failed ideas :

    Tried to refactor the update classes, to have one single UpdateData class
    but this resulted in the user id number (however, i tried on students only, 
    so maybe it was updatin with their class's id, i haven't explored this option) 
    of the data to be in every input instead of the actually updated data


Functionalities :

    Test unitaire : requiert un outil, celui que je connais est PEST, j'installerais composer, etc.
