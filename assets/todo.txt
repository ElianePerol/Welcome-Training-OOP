Bugs : 

    Display :
        main overlapping header and footer, when tables too high, messes up scroll (check student list on admin dashboard)
        "appel" card div doesn't shrink after submitting the mark-attendance form


Failed ideas :

    Tried to refactor the update classes, to have one single UpdateData class
    but this resulted in the user id number (however, i tried on students only, 
    so maybe it was updatin with their class's id, i haven't explored this option) 
    of the data to be in every input instead of the actually updated data

Functionalities :

    When creating a schedule, check there's no clashing schedule for the selected class and Teacher

    Error message when wrong email/password on login

    Success/Error messages when submitting a form

    Filter to display data in the wanted order (alphabetical for example)

    Add a weekly view of the schedules, using calendar js ?

    Display a list of subject taught per teacher

    Display a list of teacher per subject

    Prevent access to teacher or admin reserved url when connected under an inappropriate
    user, by just typing the url in the browser

Next steps :

    Add a weekly view of the schedules, using calendar js ?
