Bugs : 

    Display :
        main overlapping header and footer, when tables too high, messes up scroll (check student list on admin dashboard)
        "appel" card div doesn't shrink after submitting the mark-attendance form

    Timeout on the sucess/error message displaying when submitting a form
    which is set up in the databas/create folder, and in assets/mains

Failed ideas :

    Tried to refactor the update classes, to have one single UpdateData class
    but this resulted in the user id number (however, i tried on students only, 
    so maybe it was updatin with their class's id, i haven't explored this option) 
    of the data to be in every input instead of the actually updated data

Functionalities :

    Add a display of the attendance :
        Admin dashboard : per class, per day, per schedule : list of absent student
        Teacher dashboard : same
        Student : list of day/schedule

    When creating a schedule, check there's no clashing schedule for the selected class and Teacher

    Error message when wrong email/password on login

Next steps :

    Display students schedule of the day, with date, time, subject and teacher :
        class TodayStudentSchedules :
            methods :
                FetchTodaySchedules (to return list of schedule_id, start_time and date_time), 
                FetchTodaySubjects (to return matching list subject name), 
                FetchTodayTeachers (to return matching list teacher name)
                DisplayTodaySchedule (to display current date, time, subject and teacher of each schedule of the day)
    
    Display teacher schedule of the day, with date, time, subject and class :
        class TodayTeacherSchedules :
            methods :
                FetchTodaySchedules (to return list of schedule_id, start_time and date_time), 
                FetchTodaySubjects (to return matching list subject name), 
                FetchTodayClasses (to return matching list class name)
                DisplayTodaySchedule (to display current date, time, subject and class of each schedule of the day)
    
    Could be achieved using rather the following classes : 
        FetchTodaySchedules (to return list of schedule_id, start_time and date_time), 
        FetchTodaySubjects (to return matching list subject name),
        DisplayTodaySchedule (to display current date, time, subject and teacher of each schedule of the day)
        TodayStudentSchedules : using a FetchTodaySchedules, a FetchTodaySubjects and a DisplayTodaySchedule objects, and a FetchTodayTeachers method
        TodayTeacherSchedules : using a FetchTodaySchedules, a FetchTodaySubjects and a DisplayTodaySchedule objects, and a FetchTodayClasses method

    Mark attendance for student of ongoing schedule :
        class OngoingSchedule : 
            methods : 
                OngoingScheduleteacher returns the schedule going on at current date and time for a specific teacher
                OngoingScheduleClass returns the schedule going on at current date and time for a specific class
                OngoingScheduleSubject returns the subject going on at current date and time for a specific schedule
